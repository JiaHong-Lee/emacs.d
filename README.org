* Introduction

This is a Git repo for my Emacs dotfiles. It is derived from the Purcell emacs.d. Most of the code are copied from his.

All my configs live in the =config.org= file. On startup, the =config.el= will be generated from the Org file and be run by Emacs. 

I have defined my =init.el= inside the =config.org= file as well. At every runtime, the =init.el= will be overwritten by the one defines in the =config.org= file.
